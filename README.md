## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data science project focused on Formula 1. 
Formula 1 (a.k.a. F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned 
by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. 
The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world
since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which
all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix,
which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.

I got this Dataset Bank Marketing Analysis from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data)
This project aims to explore historical data from the Formula 1 World Championship (1950-2023), 
provide business insight related to the data, provide business recommendations related to this matter, 
and predict the best model to determine who is the next F1 World Championship winner.

## Project Highlights

- **Encoding:** Applied encoding techniques for categorical variables.

- **Outlier Analysis:** Identified and addressed outliers in the data.

- **Univariate Analysis:** Analyzed individual variables for insights.

- **Multicollinearity Analysis:** Examined multicollinearity among features.

- **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between pairs of variables.

- **Deep Dive Exploration:** Conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset.

- **Modeling with Various Algorithms:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNeighbors Classifier
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - SGD Classifier

- **Cross Validation:** Implemented cross-validation on the selected model.

## Skills Applied

- **Programming:** Implemented using Python for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied statistical methods to extract meaningful patterns from the data.
